# Bamazon
This is an Amazon clone with Node and MySQL. This Amazon-like storefront app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.  As a bonus task, students can program this app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
